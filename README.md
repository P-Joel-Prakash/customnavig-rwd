**Note**

Try to achieve the Custom Navbar as close as possible.

The logo in the Custom Navbar is the text. You can customise it by adding your favourite or initial letters.

Use the CSS properties padding-left and padding-right to give space around the content on the left side and right side of an HTML element.

Use the Bootstrap background color utilities for the background color of the Navbar.
